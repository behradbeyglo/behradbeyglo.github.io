<!-- Chronic cardio-respiratory disorders share common risk factors such as older age, lack of activity, smoking, and obesity. The symptoms of these diseases, such as shortness of breath and coughing, often worsen during sleep. One potential reason for this is that sleep is associated with physiological changes in respiration, such as humoral factors and a reduction in respiratory muscle tone and lung volume. Another potential reason is that lying down during sleep causes body fluids to shift from the legs to the heart, lungs and neck. This fluid accumulation in the lungs and neck then causes narrowing of the airway; however, little is known about the link between sleep, fluid shifts and exacerbated respiratory disease. -->

`SleepdB is a sound-proof laboratory developed to examine sleep-disordered breathing that leverages novel and non-invasive acoustic monitoring technologies.`

`SleepdB` is one of the few laboratories in the world dedicated to understanding the intricate interplay between sleep, body fluid shifts and respiratory disease, including but not limited to obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, and COPD. We utilize physiological experiments with human participants, as well as an artificial intelligence based approach to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms in the interaction between diseases. The research group also develops novel technologies for the long-term monitoring of physiological signals that occur during sleep and when awake, with the ultimate goal to improve disease management and prevent exacerbation and hospitalization.
